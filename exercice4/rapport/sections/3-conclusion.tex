\section{Conclusion}

Through this report, we analysed the behavior of a small thermodynamic system, a cylinder placed in a thermal bath. Using the finite element method allowed us to simulate this system. In the case of a constant heat and thermal conductivity, we found that the mesh layout of the finite element method had a great influence on the convergence and precision of this system, when compared to the analytical solution. Some physical properties like the power balance were also mostly conserved. In a non-homogeneous case, we also observed the difference in behavior for different mesh configurations and density. It was found that the best one was not the same for both cases indicating the importance of choosing the right mesh. Finally, a curious observation was made when changing the integration method, which matched the analytical solution exactly at the mesh nodes!
