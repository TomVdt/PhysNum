\section{Conclusion}

Through this report, we analysed the behavior of a small thermodynamic system, a cylinder placed in a heat source. Using the finite element method allowed us to simulate this system. In the case of a constant heat and thermal conductivity, we found that the mesh layout of the finite element method had a great influence on the convergence and precision of this system, when compared to the analytical solution. Some physical properties like the power balance were also mostly conserved. In a non-constant case, we also observed the difference in behavior for different mesh configurations and density. Finally, a curious observation was made when changing the integration method, which matched the analytical solution exactly at the mesh nodes!
