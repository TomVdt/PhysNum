\section{Introduction}

\textbf{BLABLA INTRO JSP}
In this report, we will study the temperature and heat transfer of a cylinder surrounded by a heat source through multiple simulations, varying the cylinder's heat and temperature transfer properties. For this, the finite element method will be used.

The first simulation will consider a case where the heat source and and thermal conductivity are constant, allowing us to compare the simulations to the theoretical results. The convergence of different mesh configurations will also be analysed. In a second simulation, the heat source and thermal conductivity will vary depending on position. A comparaison between a low and high amount of mesh points will be done, as well as a convergence study.
