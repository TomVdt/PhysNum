\section{Introduction}

Finite element analysis is a very widely used method of numerical simulation with applications in nearly all STEM fields. From predicting biomechanical phenomena \cite{body} to characterising thermal expansion in a nuclear reactor \cite{nuke} this method can be used in various ways. In this report, we will use finite elements to conduct several simulations in order to test this method and analyse its coherence with the physical reality. The goal will be to determine the temperature and heat flux profiles of a cylinder surrounded by a thermal bath knowing its heat source and thermal conductivity properties.

The first simulation will consider a case where the heat source and thermal conductivity are constant, allowing us to compare the simulations to theoretical results. The convergence of different mesh configurations will also be analysed. In a second simulation, the heat source and thermal conductivity will vary depending on position. A comparison between different more or less precise meshes will be done, as well as a convergence study.
