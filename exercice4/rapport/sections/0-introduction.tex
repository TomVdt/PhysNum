\section{Introduction}

Finite element analysis is a very widely used method of numerical simulations with applications in nearly all STEM fields and beyond. From predicting biomechanical phenomena \cite{body} to characterising thermal expansion in a nuclear reactor \cite{nuke} this method can be used in various ways. In this report, we will thus use finite elements to conduct several simulations of the same system to test this method. The goal will be to determine the temperature and heat flux profiles of a cylinder surrounded by a thermal bath when varying its heat source and thermal conductivity properties.

The first simulation will consider a case where the heat source and thermal conductivity are constant, allowing us to compare the simulations to theoretical results. The convergence of different mesh configurations will also be analysed. In a second simulation, the heat source and thermal conductivity will vary depending on position. A comparaison between a low and high amount of mesh points will be done, as well as a convergence study.
