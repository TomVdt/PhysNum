\section{Conclusion}

In this report we studied the velocity required for Webb to reach its desired orbit distance and simulated the specific transfer orbit using the fixed and adaptative timestep methods. Results show that the adaptative method allows a much greater precision at a lower computational cost, even with both methods converging in order 4 for this situation. Motion around the L2 Lagrange point was studied and we observed the instability of this point. Again, the adaptative method provided good results for far fewer steps. It was observed that starting from L2 with a small downwards perturbation resulted in an exponential growth of the distance between Webb and L2. Finally, a study of the potential was done to reveal the stability of the L2 point and show the presence of other Lagrange points, notably L1.
