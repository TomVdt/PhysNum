\section{Simulations}

\subsection{Implementation notes}

\subsection{Transfer orbit}

\subsection{Around Lagrange L2}

We now consider the reduced 3-body problem, like in \ref{sec:3body_reduced}. The simulations are done in the \(\mathcal R'\) reference frame, placing Webb at the Lagrange L2 point given in \ref{sec:lagrange_L2} and giving the satelite an initial downwards speed \(\dot y = -0.1\) m/s. We will first analyse the convergence of both methods.
