\section{Analytical results}

For the purpose of this study it is first needed to prove some analytical results that will later be achieved through numerical simulations.

We are considering a sphere (tennis ball) of mass $m$ and radius $R$. It is rotating according to $\vec{\omega} = \omega \vec{e_z}$. It is moving in the gravity field $\vec{g} = -g\vec{e_y}$ and inside a fluid of density $\rho$ which applies a force due to the Magnus effect:
\be
    \vec{F}_p = \mu R^3 \rho \vec{\omega} \times \vec{v}
\ee

We want to determine the movement of the ball knowing the initial velocity $\vec{v_0}$ and rotation $\vec{\omega}$. In an effort to simplify the problem we assume that the rotation is constant and we consider trajectories occuring only on the $(x,y)$ plan.
