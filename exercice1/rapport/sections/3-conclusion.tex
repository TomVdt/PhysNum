\section{Conclusion}

Through this report, we showed the differences between the EE, IE, and SE methods and analysed their numerical convergence and stability under different conditions. While the EE and IE methods drifted off the analytical solution, the SE method remained very close to it. It was also notable that the energy of the EE increased exponentially meaning that this method is highly unstable while the IE and SE methods did not have this problem. The main physical takeaway from this analysis is that ignoring air drag can have a major impact on the final results with one situation showing a periodic behavior near the starting height and the other being a deflected fall.
