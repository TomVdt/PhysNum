\section{Introduction}

In this paper we aim at giving a comprehensive numerical analysis of a typical case study, the trajectory of a rotating ball under the influence of the Magnus effect. This analysis will be done using three related types of algorithms: Euler explicit, implicit and semi-implicit.

The algorithms used will be implemented through a C++ simulation and the obtained data analysed using classic python libraries. Aaaaaa yes no gravity aaaa yes with gravity and traine aerodynamique yes yes baguette. % TODO: write about the different simulations ran
Some analytical results will also be proven in order to verify the soundness of our simulation by comparing them to computational results.
