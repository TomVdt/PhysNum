\section{Conclusion}
We have analysed numerous conditions for waves in water. The first simulations showed known behaviors in waters with constant depth and allowed to study propagation, reflection and normal modes of waves as well as the characteristics of our simulation. We have found that this simulation is stable for CFL values smaller or equal to 1 and confirmed that it converges to analytical results in order 1. We then considered a more complex case with a wave approaching a shore with non-uniform depth. This simulation allowed to study the behavior of waves in this case with variations in amplitude and velocity. Our simulations were also compared to an analytical approximation. It was found that for the domain of approximation chosen (here a slowly changing depth) both were coherent. To see the limits of this approximation simulations were made outside of this domain and showed a clear difference between the two. A final point was made by considering the classical wave equation that was shown not to work for a non constant depth.
