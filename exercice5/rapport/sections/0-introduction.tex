\section{Introduction}

The study of waves is an important subject in physics. However, it can often be very hard to explicitly solve wave equations. Numerical simulations then become crucial for the study of those waves. In this report, we will study a wave propagating in water, first a small basin with a flat bottom and then an oceanic wave propagating towards a coral reef, where the depth of the ocean can change considerably. Behaviors like reflection, normal modes, amplitude and speed change will be studied. The stability limit of the explicit numerical method used for the simulations will also be studied.
